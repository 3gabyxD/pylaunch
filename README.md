# Pyrun
Something like `DMenu` or `Rofi` but for windows and made in Python with Pygame. The shortcuts folder (by default) is located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pyrun\` and you can populate it by running `pyrun.py <folder>` where the shortcuts are in (i.e. Desktop).

I used AutoHotKey to run the script. You can put a shortcut of the AHK script at `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
